# 🧠🖱️ AI Mouse Controller Using Eyes & Hand

This project allows you to control your mouse cursor using your **eyes** and **hand gestures** with the help of **AI-powered computer vision**. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, it provides a hands-free and contactless way to interact with your computer—perfect for accessibility, touchless interfaces, and futuristic computing!

## 📌 Features

- 👁️ Eye-tracking to control cursor movement  
- ✋ Hand gesture detection for mouse click actions  
- 🤖 AI-based face and hand landmark tracking using MediaPipe  
- 🎯 Real-time control with minimal latency  
- 🖥️ Works with a standard webcam  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV 🎥  
- Mediapipe 🔬  
- PyAutoGUI 📍 (for controlling mouse)  
- NumPy 🔢  

---

## 📷 Demo

> Coming soon: GIF or video demo showing real-time mouse control using eyes and hand gestures.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-mouse-controller.git
cd ai-mouse-controller
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ✨ How It Works

- **Face Mesh & Eye Tracking**: Detects eyes and estimates direction to move the cursor.  
- **Hand Tracking**: Detects specific hand gestures (like pinching or open palm) to perform click, drag, or scroll actions.  
- **Mouse Control**: Translates the visual input into real-time mouse actions using PyAutoGUI.

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add blinking detection for mouse clicks  
- Improve gesture detection accuracy  
- Add calibration for different screen sizes and eye positions  
- Support for dual-hand mode (left click/right click)
